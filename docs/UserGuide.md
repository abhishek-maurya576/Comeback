# Smart Chat Mode User Guide

## Getting Started

Smart Chat Mode is an entertaining feature that lets you engage in witty conversations with an AI assistant. The AI will respond to your messages with clever comebacks based on your selected "roast" intensity.

## How to Use

### Accessing Smart Chat Mode
1. Open the Comeback app
2. Tap on the "Smart Chat" option from the main menu

### Choosing a Roast Type
Before sending your message, select one of the three roast intensity options:
- **Mild**: Gentle, playful responses suitable for all audiences
- **Sarcastic**: Witty, sarcastic responses with moderate intensity
- **Savage**: Brutally honest and intense responses (use with friends who can take a joke!)

### Sending Messages
1. Type your message in the text field at the bottom of the screen
2. Tap the send button (paper airplane icon)
3. Wait a moment for the AI to generate a response
4. The response will appear in the chat with stylized text formatting

### Managing Your Chat
- **Delete Messages**: Tap the trash icon in the top-right corner of any message to remove it
- **Share Responses**: Tap the share icon on any AI response to share it via other apps
- **Clear Chat**: Tap the clear button at the top of the screen to remove all messages

## Tips for Better Responses
- Be specific in your messages for more targeted comebacks
