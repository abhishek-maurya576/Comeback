## Technical Details

- **ViewModel Layer**: Business logic and state management

### Tech Stack
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 design system
- **Navigation**: Compose Navigation
- **State Management**: Flow, StateFlow with Compose State
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp for API communication
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for content generation and Smart Chat responses
- **Text Formatting**: Compose Markdown for rich text display

## Smart Chat Mode

The new Smart Chat Mode feature allows users to:
- Exchange messages with an AI assistant that provides witty comebacks
- Choose between three "roast" intensities: Mild, Sarcastic, and Savage
- Share AI-generated responses with friends
- View stylized responses with markdown formatting
- Delete or clear message history

See the [Smart Chat Mode documentation](./docs/SmartChatMode.md) for more technical details.

## Easter Eggs

The app includes hidden mini-games that can be triggered by tapping the app logo three times on the home screen:

1. **Color Match Game**: Match the displayed color in a timed challenge
2. **Memory Game**: Find matching pairs of fruit emoji cards
3. **Spin Logo Game**: Tap the spinning logo as many times as possible before time runs out
