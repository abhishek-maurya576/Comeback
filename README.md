## Easter Eggs

The app includes hidden mini-games that can be triggered by tapping the app logo three times on the home screen:

1. **Color Match Game**: Match the displayed color in a timed challenge
2. **Memory Game**: Find matching pairs of fruit emoji cards
3. **Spin Logo Game**: Tap the spinning logo as many times as possible before time runs out
