# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the Comeback App on GitHub while ensuring the API keys remain private.

## Initial Repository Setup

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "comeback-app")
   - Add a description (optional)
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll add our own)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Initialize your local repository:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/comeback-app
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. Link to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/comeback-app.git
   git branch -M main
   ```

4. Before pushing, make sure the API key is protected:
   - Verify that `.gitignore` includes `local.properties`
   - Confirm that your API key is only in the `local.properties` file and not hardcoded elsewhere
   - Check that `local.properties.example` exists and is properly formatted (without real keys)

5. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## API Key Security Review

Before making your repository public (if that's your intention), double-check:

1. **No API Keys in Code**: Search your codebase for any hardcoded keys or secrets:
   ```bash
   grep -r "AIza" --include="*.kt" --include="*.xml" .
   ```

2. **Proper .gitignore Setup**: Ensure these files are in your `.gitignore`:
   - `local.properties`
   - `*.keystore` and `*.jks`
   - `google-services.json`
   - Build outputs

3. **Sensitive Files Check**: Verify no sensitive files were accidentally committed:
   ```bash
   git ls-files | grep -iE 'key|secret|password|credential'
   ```

4. **Documentation**: Ensure your README and documentation explain how to obtain and configure API keys

## GitHub Repository Settings

Once your code is pushed:

1. Set up branch protection rules for the main branch:
   - Go to Settings > Branches > Add rule
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Enable "Require pull request reviews before merging"

2. Add appropriate topics to your repository to improve discoverability:
   - android
   - kotlin
   - jetpack-compose
   - material-design
   - gemini-ai

3. Set up a good README as the repository landing page:
   - Rename `GITHUB_README.md` to `README.md` or merge its contents with the existing README

4. Add license information if needed:
   - Consider using the MIT License for open-source projects
   - Add the license file to your repository

## CI/CD Setup (Optional)

If you want to set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory
2. Add workflow YAML files for:
   - Building the project
   - Running tests
   - Linting and code quality checks

3. For the Gemini API key, use GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add a new secret named `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your key
   - Reference it in your workflows as `${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}`

## Final Steps

1. Review your repository to ensure all sensitive data is protected
2. Update documentation with GitHub-specific information
3. Consider setting up issue templates and contribution guidelines

Remember that even with these precautions, API keys in client-side code (even when loaded from local properties) can be extracted from the compiled APK. For production apps, consider using a backend proxy for API calls.
